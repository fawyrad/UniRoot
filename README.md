## What's new in V5

- **New exploit (fast)** — the unprivileged DirtyFrag engine (CVE-2026-43284): IpSecManager allocates the SA, the native engine corrupts the kernel page cache, ksud is late-loaded from memory. No profile, no Shizuku, no setup — press **Root now**.
- **ksud updater, in the app** — a full-width button (New exploit section) downloads the **latest official ksud** (KernelSU Next *or* classic, per the selected flavor) and patches it **on device** with the bundled **Samsung KDP+DEFEX .kos**, then the result is used immediately (Next → auto-selected profile, classic → `ksud-classic-latest`). Already updated? → *"you are already updated"*.
- **ksud profiles** — profile bands (same style as the old exploit profiles) for both flavors: bundled + downloaded profiles, selectable, and deletable from **Advanced settings**.
- **Auto-root at boot** — a foreground boot service waits for the first unlock and re-runs the chain (up to 6 attempts), with a partial WakeLock so the phone can't sleep mid-exploit.
- **Progress UI** — animated progress bar with live engine stages (IpSec SA → SPI → ksud staged → arming → **Phone rooted ✓**), and a bottom progress popup for the ksud updater. Fully in English.
- **Root state banner** — clean Rooted / Not rooted banner driven by a live `su -c id` probe (no more false "rooted" after a reboot).

## Old exploit (slow)

The classic profile pipeline stays untouched: CVE-2026-43499 payloads (local or Shizuku), Root My Galaxy integration, per-device validated profiles (S25 ZZHL/ZZI4, S26 Ultra ZZHK, S93XX, Oppo), profile editor, instant root, and run-log archives.
